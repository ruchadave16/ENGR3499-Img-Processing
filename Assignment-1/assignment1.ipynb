    "In this assignment, we are tasked with getting acquainted with images of varying resolutions and colors using Python. To do this, we graphed histograms of each image that described all of its pixel values, and then chose a threshold by which we converted the pixels to a binary. Then, we plotted new images using their new binary values and analyzed the result. We worked with the following types of images to achieve this task:\n",

    "- Low resolution image (640 x 480)\n",
