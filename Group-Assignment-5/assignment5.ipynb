    "Increasing rho seemed to increase the number of fine lines that would be detected. When i set rho to 1, the number of lines was less, but more straightforward and detecting the more prominent lines. Increasing it increased the number of lines I would see. Similarly, changing threshold would directly affect how many lines there were, but more in the sense of what would be considered heavy enough to be a line. When I set the threshold high, only edges that were truly obviously line-like would be marked. "
